## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- pnpm (recommended) or npm
- Stellar account for testing

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Orbit-Wal/Globe-Wallet.git
cd Globe-Wallet

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run development server
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

### Environment Setup
Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`, then update values for your environment:
```
cp .env.example .env.local
```

The app validates its environment during startup and prints actionable errors for missing or malformed values. Run `npm run check:env` after changing the schema or `.env.example`.

4. Push to branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Testing

### Testing strategy

Globe Wallet targets **>90% coverage** on business logic in `lib/`, `hooks/`, and `components/` (see `jest.config.js`). Full details, API contracts, and the QA checklist live in [docs/issue-30.md](docs/issue-30.md).

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `npm test` | Full Jest suite (unit, component, integration, property) |
| `npm run test:unit` | Service and utility unit tests |
| `npm run test:component` | React Testing Library component tests |
| `npm run test:integration` | API routes and service integration |
| `npm run test:a11y` | jest-axe component accessibility scans (Issue #24) |
| `npm run test:a11y:e2e` | Playwright + axe E2E accessibility scans (Issue #24) |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Coverage report with 90% global threshold |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Playwright end-to-end tests |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint |
| `npm run build` | Production build verification |

**E2E highlights**

- Send flow (issue #23): `npm run test:e2e -- --grep "Send Flow"`
- Receive flow (issue #22): `npm run test:e2e -- --grep "Receive Flow"`
- Dashboard integration (issue #30): `npm run test:e2e -- --grep "Issue #30"`
- Accessibility audit (issue #24): `npm run test:a11y:e2e`

CI runs lint, build, all Jest layers, Playwright, and coverage on every push/PR to `main`. Successful merges to `main` POST merge analytics to `MERGE_ANALYTICS_URL` (repository secret).

### Browser Testing
All wallet flows are verified in supported browsers:
- Chrome/Chromium 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

### Test Scenarios
- Wallet creation and import
- XLM sending and receiving
- Currency conversion flows
- Off-ramp processes
- UI responsiveness across devices
